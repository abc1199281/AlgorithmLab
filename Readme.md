# Algorithm Lab

## Motivation: algorithm notes for an interview
In this repository, algorithm notes are provided to **bridge the algorithm theorem and leet code problems** [1,2].

If we only practice the leet code problems, we might be lost and frustrated to the lack of systemetic iamge of algorithm.
If we only read the algorithm bible [1], we might still not be able to solve leetcode problems within a reasonable time, because there are many variants aspects to the same algorithm. 

To link the algorithm theorem and leet code problems, the layouts of forders follows the outline of [1]. Besides, the experiments which are not covered in the book are located in the folder **other** or the folder with same topic, but labeled with star sign.

There are difficulty for you to explore, which basically follow the classificatino of leetcode [2].

As others have said, the book [1] is called the bible of Algorithm. Unless stated otherwise, the chapter number in this repository follows this book.
2. [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/)  
This website provide very good questions.
